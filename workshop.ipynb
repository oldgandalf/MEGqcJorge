    "# 1. Install/download the environment on your machine.\n",
    "# 2. Clone MEGqc from Github: (write the command here).\n",
    "# 3. Download test data from the cloud: (give share link here)\n",
    "#    Or copy it from a USB stick.\n",
    "#    Or use your own data (only .fif files are supported).\n",
    "# 4. In case you use your own data, please make sure it is organised according to the BIDS standard.\n",
    "#    If it is not, you can form BIDS-compliant directory structure around your .fif file and change the file name:\n",
    "#    1) Download dummy directory structure from the cloud: (give share link here) and place your file into ... folder\n",
    "#    Or from the USB stick.\n",
    "#    2) Change the file name to: sub-001_task-rest_meg.fif\n",
    "# 5. Adjust the settings file settings.ini: \n",
    "#    1) Give the path to your data set in 'data_directory' parameter.\n",
    "#    2) Set cropping of the data to ~2 min (120 sec) in 'crop_data' parameter to ensure faster execution fro this trial.\n",
    "#    3) If desired, set some of the metrics to False. If you use the examplary data sey downloaded from the cloud, please keep Head metric as False. \n",
    "#       This data set does not contain head position recording of a good quality, and it will take significant time to produce the unseccessful result for this metric.\n",
    "#    4) To save time, process just 1 subject for this trial. Set 'subjects' parameter to your desired subject identifier, such as 009 or 001.\n",
    "#       To process all subjects set this parameter to 'all'.\n",
